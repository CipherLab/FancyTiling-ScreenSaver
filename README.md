# FancyTiling-ScreenSaver
A simple photo slideshow screensaver that fills a higher resolution screen by mirroring the top/bottom/left/right sides of the image.

I still need to optomize the code, and just generally clean it up. I'd like to try an XNA mode so I can do some simple pan/zooms. 

It will take an image and copy the top/bottom and/or right/left sides of the image by the number of pixels it would take to fill the screen.

Flip/Flop the copied areas and append them to the original in a image that is the screen resolution
